# Sprint_Review

These documents mark conclusion to the Software developoment lifecyle course, as per request I will answer the following questions:

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User stories are a powerful tool. They allow the user to express a need, and the development team to identify what needs to happen to satisfy that need. User stories are a convienent way to bundle certain tasks together, and sort them amongst a team appropriately.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Making a program is simple as having a clear, shared vision between you and your team. This is not always easy, so scrum-agile methodologies employ tools to make this happen much more effciently. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Do your part, and seek to assist others. Ask for help whan needed and be clear in communicating what you need. Take care of your team, and they will take care of you.
